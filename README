# Text in Images

This is a steganography project, where through manipulating the least 4 significant bits of the pixels of an image,
we are able to put  UTF-8/ASCII information inside an image, without changing the image too much.

It allows us to create an image with embedded information that is almost undetectable, so that it can be shared around
to distribute hidden information. It has the ability to both read and insert information, and is used with a terminal
interface and a GUI for selecting items.

It can also insert text files into images, as long as its UTF-8 or ASCII.
